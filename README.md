###### A Gui improvment mod for Hypixel 

This is a small (not so small now) project I've been working on. It changes the in-game GUI to better suit skyblock, for example:

* Implementation of a hp and mp bar
* Removes the scoreboard and everything that was displayed in it it's now shown is a much more appealing way
* An inventory traffic list
* Removed the rendering of the hunger & health bar
* Shows potion effects on the screen
* Warning icons that appear for things like Trade requests, Inventory Full, Too many coins on you, and other stuff
* Custom NPC GUIS

### Note! 
* The GUI can be toggled on/off with [right ctrl] and the settings menu can be opened using the [M] key.
* It only has support for Forge version 1.8.9.
* You can toggle on/off the GUI anywhere but it will only work correctly on Hypixel Skyblock.
